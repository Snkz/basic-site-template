Improved engine and new flames

It's been a crazy year, I've moved to Vancouver, jumped jobs twice and am more deadset then ever on building this thing out

I've learned alot at artillery and maxis, mostly about engine design and entity component systems. I've trashed most of my old code and rebuilt 
the voxel engine as a proper game engine. I've put in alot of work on the lua bindings and now have a clean interface between lua code and c++ code
that's all handled behind the scenes my the engine. All C++ components and events can be have lua code bound to them by simply adding handlers such as OnEventName(arg1, ... argN) with no fancy bridge code other then a single macro, DEFINE_EVENT(onEventName, argType1 ... argTypeN). Theres also macros for exposing any memeber variable of a class to lua allowing for the lua file to both read and set the value. Its cool. I'll show it off here at somepoint.

Thats all nice and everything but I still haven't built a new game since 2014 and I want that to change this coming year. I'm working fast towards a prototype trying to minimize distractions (Its so hard to not work on fun rendering stuff). My current fulltime job has great work life balance so things are looking up.

<strong> You will hear from me again soon! </strong>
