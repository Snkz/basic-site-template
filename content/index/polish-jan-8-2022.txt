Learning to polish

I'm not apologizing, I'll just try to do better then yesterday with how often I write.

Covid is running on year 3 now and its not been the best for my work ethic. However I'm incredibly happy with how my art has improved over the last year.
The main thing is detailing, leaving blank walls, floors, solid colours etc I thought looked fine; gave it a toy box/doll house feel I thought. Now though I feel more then anything it just comes off as unfinished. If I were generating content programmatically I think I could get away with this but I am not. Hell if the game wasnt based on an IP I think I could of gotten away with it.

The detailing I will try to focus on for any new scenes and characters I make are:
1. No solid colours. Break it up with blotches of slightly saturated version of w/e colour.
2. Avoid large flat areas, delete a voxel or two, add more objects.
3. Walls and floors must have a pattern, but that pattern cannot take up the whole area. Solid is fine to accent.


My latest posts on twitter I think show the imporvement. Because of this too i'm more confident about rendering at higher resolutions instead of going for the 480x320 pixelated look. I think its better for it overall.

I'm more deadset on making a medabots game now too, even without the license I'm at the point where I'm willing to get this game out as free downloaded if needed. Maybe open up a patreon to earn something off it. I want to finish this, at any cost!

<strong> Until my next post, see you here or on Guilty Gear Stive's tower! </strong>
