    <h4> Learning to polish </h4>
    <p>I'm not apologizing, I'll just try to do better then yesterday with how often I write.</p><p></p><p>Covid is running on year 3 now and its not been the best for my work ethic. However I'm incredibly happy with how my art has improved over the last year.</p><p>The main thing is detailing, leaving blank walls, floors, solid colours etc I thought looked fine; gave it a toy box/doll house feel I thought. Now though I feel more then anything it just comes off as unfinished. If I were generating content programmatically I think I could get away with this but I am not. Hell if the game wasnt based on an IP I think I could of gotten away with it.</p><p></p><p>The detailing I will try to focus on for any new scenes and characters I make are:</p><p>1. No solid colours. Break it up with blotches of slightly saturated version of w/e colour.</p><p>2. Avoid large flat areas, delete a voxel or two, add more objects.</p><p>3. Walls and floors must have a pattern, but that pattern cannot take up the whole area. Solid is fine to accent.</p><p></p><p></p><p>My latest posts on twitter I think show the imporvement. Because of this too i'm more confident about rendering at higher resolutions instead of going for the 480x320 pixelated look. I think its better for it overall.</p><p></p><p>I'm more deadset on making a medabots game now too, even without the license I'm at the point where I'm willing to get this game out as free downloaded if needed. Maybe open up a patreon to earn something off it. I want to finish this, at any cost!</p><p></p><p><strong> Until my next post, see you here or on Guilty Gear Stive's tower! </strong></p><p></p>

    <h4> Getting back to blogging </h4>
    <p>Hello yes this site is still active ...</p><p></p><p>I haven't made time to update this site in a long time but I still really love it. Having a record of thoughts from now 7 years ago is so inspiring and sometimes pretty cringey... feels good to share it either way. Still love the aesthetic though and of course am still actively developing the game engine. However I mostly update that on twitter now. Please check out images and gifs there.</p><p></p><p>Since the last blog update, I've switched jobs once more and managed to get a sick work schedule a year in. This gave me so much time to really build out the game. Its honestly come along way from its humble roots as a <a href="http://abdi.dahir.ca/breakblox.html">voxel render</a>. I think i'm a bit addicted to world building/story telling though so I'm hoping to make it a decently long (10hrs?) rpg in the medabots universe. I love the characters and maybe I can get the license, if not, generic mini-robot-battler go! I'm still designing as I make tech so nothing is really set in stone but I'm alot more structured about it all now though and the number of things the game can be gets smaller and smaller each day which is a great sign if I ever want to finish haha.</p><p></p><p>I'm on and off with how heads down I am with working on this normally, but covid this year has made it a bit rocky. Something about staying in to do work when I just spent all day working from home on my official job isnt really too enticing ...</p><p></p><p><strong> You will hear from me again ... soon ... probably! </strong></p><p></p>

    <h4> Improved engine and new flames </h4>
    <p>It's been a crazy year, I've moved to Vancouver, jumped jobs twice and am more deadset then ever on building this thing out</p><p></p><p>I've learned alot at artillery and maxis, mostly about engine design and entity component systems. I've trashed most of my old code and rebuilt</p><p>the voxel engine as a proper game engine. I've put in alot of work on the lua bindings and now have a clean interface between lua code and c++ code</p><p>that's all handled behind the scenes my the engine. All C++ components and events can be have lua code bound to them by simply adding handlers such as OnEventName(arg1, ... argN) with no fancy bridge code other then a single macro, DEFINE_EVENT(onEventName, argType1 ... argTypeN). Theres also macros for exposing any memeber variable of a class to lua allowing for the lua file to both read and set the value. Its cool. I'll show it off here at somepoint.</p><p></p><p>Thats all nice and everything but I still haven't built a new game since 2014 and I want that to change this coming year. I'm working fast towards a prototype trying to minimize distractions (Its so hard to not work on fun rendering stuff). My current fulltime job has great work life balance so things are looking up.</p><p></p><p><strong> You will hear from me again soon! </strong></p><p></p><p></p>
