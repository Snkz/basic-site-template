Getting back to blogging

Hello yes this site is still active ...

I haven't made time to update this site in a long time but I still really love it. Having a record of thoughts from now 7 years ago is so inspiring and sometimes pretty cringey... feels good to share it either way. Still love the aesthetic though and of course am still actively developing the game engine. However I mostly update that on twitter now. Please check out images and gifs there.

Since the last blog update, I've switched jobs once more and managed to get a sick work schedule a year in. This gave me so much time to really build out the game. Its honestly come along way from its humble roots as a <a href="http://abdi.dahir.ca/breakblox.html">voxel render</a>. I think i'm a bit addicted to world building/story telling though so I'm hoping to make it a decently long (10hrs?) rpg in the medabots universe. I love the characters and maybe I can get the license, if not, generic mini-robot-battler go! I'm still designing as I make tech so nothing is really set in stone but I'm alot more structured about it all now though and the number of things the game can be gets smaller and smaller each day which is a great sign if I ever want to finish haha.

I'm on and off with how heads down I am with working on this normally, but covid this year has made it a bit rocky. Something about staying in to do work when I just spent all day working from home on my official job isnt really too enticing ...

<strong> You will hear from me again ... soon ... probably! </strong>
